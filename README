These are the local ebuilds I have had to create in the course of my work.  As such they are typically related to science and/or imaging.

media-libs/openslide
	C library that provides a simple interface to read whole-slide images, aka virtual slides

sci-biology/structure
	Free software package for using multi-locus genotype data to investigate population structure

x11-misc/virtualgl
	Run OpenGL applications on remote display software with full 3D hardware acceleration
